# Hangman-game
This project is an implementation of the traditional Hangman game. The program randomly selects a secret word, the player tries to guess it one letter at a time. The game displays the progress with underscores representing unguessed letters &amp; tracks the number of attempts left. The player wins by guessing all letters before running out of attempts.
